Time Series Forecasting with ANN & LSTM

Overview:

This project focuses on predicting crude oil prices using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. It demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in time series forecasting by comparing ANN and LSTM architectures.

Features:

✔ Data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization)
✔ ANN and LSTM implementation using TensorFlow/Keras
✔ Performance evaluation using MAE, RMSE
✔ Comparison of ANN vs. LSTM in capturing long-term dependencies

Technologies Used:

Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:

jupyter notebook time-series-forecasting-with-ann-lstm.ipynb

Results:

ANN provides basic pattern recognition but struggles with sequential dependencies.
LSTM outperforms ANN by retaining long-term dependencies, making it more suitable for time series forecasting.
